# java-spring-crud

- A continuation of the previous project (https://github.com/EarthCaspian/java-spring-orm) as a separate project which adds CRUD operations via REST.

- This is a sandbox environment. For now, besides basic crud, the api includes security implementations via spring security features and authentication using JWT.
