# java-spring-crud

- A continuation of the previous project (https://github.com/EarthCaspian/java-spring-orm) as a separate project which adds CRUD operations via REST.

- This is basically a sandbox environment for me to try and test features. Currently, besides basic crud, it incorporates security implementations via spring security features and authentication using JWT.
