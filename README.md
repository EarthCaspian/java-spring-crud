# java-spring-crud

- A continuation of the previous project (https://github.com/EarthCaspian/java-spring-orm) as a separate project that adds CRUD operations via REST.

- This is a sandbox environment. It's meant to test spring features. Besides basic crud, the API includes security implementations via spring security features and authentication using JWT.
